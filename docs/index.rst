General Information
===================

  .. warning:: Project is currently in pre-alpha phase. API may change and backwards compatibility is **NOT** guaranteed at all.

  This project is created as a replacement for current IM services by the people who are tired from endless memory leaks in clients and constant remote server crashes. We (are going to) provide fully open-source client and server with ability to host your own instance on your own server.
